This program prompts the user to enter the number of movie reviewers and the number of movies being rated. It then prompts the user to enter the ratings for each movie, row by row, between 1 and 10. The program stores the ratings in a 2D array.

After the ratings have been entered, the program calculates and prints the average rating for each reviewer. It does this by iterating through each row of the 2D array (corresponding to a single reviewer) and calculating the sum of the ratings. It then divides the sum by the number of movies to get the average rating.

The program uses a class called MyArrays, which has a single method called printAverageReviewerRating. This method takes in the 2D array of ratings, the number of reviewers, and the number of movies, and it prints out the average rating for each reviewer.

The program uses comments to explain what each part of the code does. It also follows good coding practices such as using descriptive variable names and creating separate methods for different functionality.
